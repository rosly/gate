Compare current Adafruit code
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PN532/blob/master/Adafruit_PN532.cpp
with our libary and implement missing Mifare functions:
- authentication
- read write
Hint: lokk at adafruit_pn532_in_data_exchange() function. Seems that new
adafruit code does not use this function anymore and instead they create
PN532_COMMAND_INDATAEXCHANGE buffers for exery type of function. This is more
clean solution in my opinion while adafruit_pn532_in_data_exchange() could
possibly save some code in case we would like to support multiple tag types
